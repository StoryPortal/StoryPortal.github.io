  <h1>P3Q3</h1>
  <p> Your eyes go wide, the witch seems to know what you saw.  Desperate to get out of the witch’s nest, you look for an exit.  <br>
    You ask politely for the restroom, hoping the witch doesn’t realize your desperation to exit.  “Down the hall, 3rd door on the right” she says, <br>
    a crooked smile forming at the edge of her lips.  <br> 

    Once in the hallway, you race to the nearest room with a window. 
    As you look out, you momentarily forget your fear as your eyes fall upon a twisting vortex in the middle of the Puget Sound.  
    You swear you can hear music coming from the vortex, but aren’t sure if it’s just your nerves tricking you. 
    The sight is distracting, you grow calmer.  Your thoughts drift to the pastry you ate earlier, wow were they good.
    You sit down for a moment to rest: you’ve been through a lot.  
    The thought of a flaky pastry is the last thing to flash through your mind’s eye as you drift into a blissful sleep.

    In your sleep, you appear next to the swirling vortex you saw in the water.  Something tells you it’s a portal leading you somewhere you *really* want to visit.  
    The music you thought you heard emanates loudly from somewhere within the vortex.  You reach out a hand, then your leg, and then let your body pass through the portal. 
    The music rises… you think you can see a few butterflies...
