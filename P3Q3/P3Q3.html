  <h1>P3Q3</h1>
  <p> Your eyes go wide, the witch seems to know what you saw.  <br><br>
    Desperate to get out of the witch’s nest, you look for an exit.  <br><br>
    You ask politely for the restroom, hoping the witch doesn’t realize your desperation to leave.  <br><br>
    “Down the hall, 3rd door on the right” she says.  <br><br>

    Once in the hallway, you race to the nearest room with a window.  <br><br>
    As you look out, you momentarily forget your fear as your eyes fall upon a twisting vortex in the middle of the Puget Sound.   <br><br>
    You swear you can hear music coming from the vortex, but aren’t sure if it’s just your nerves tricking you.  <br><br>
    The sight is distracting, and you grow calmer.  <br><br>
    Your thoughts drift to the pastry you ate earlier, wow were they good. <br><br>
    You sit down for a moment to rest:  <br><br> <br><br> <br><br>
    you’ve been through a lot.   <br><br> <br><br>
    The thought of a flaky pastry is the last thing to flash through your mind as you drift into a blissful sleep. <br><br>

     <br><br> <br><br> <br><br>
    In your sleep, you appear next to the swirling vortex you saw in the water.  <br><br>
    It entices you. You want to get closer to hear the curious music better. <br><br>
    The music you thought you heard emanates loudly from somewhere within the vortex.   <br><br>
    You reach out a hand,  <br><br>
    then your leg,  <br><br>
    and then let your body pass through the portal.  <br><br> 
    The music rises…  <br><br>
    you think you can see a few butterflies...
