  <h1>P2Q1</h1>
  <p>Ok. I think youâ€™re going to have a NICE DAYâ€¦

  You head out of the house, oblivious to the rest of the world.  As you step out of the door, you see a shooting star! <br><br> 
  Itâ€™s your l u c k y day!  <br><br> 
  Youâ€™ve never seen a shooting star during the day!  Your brain is OVERLOADED with dopamine.   <br><br> 
    You search the sky for more day stars :)  <br><br> 
  The stars notice you watching them. ðŸ˜¯  <br><br> 
  
  The stars arrive in duos, trios, then a whole ensemble.   <br><br> 
  As you walk along, you feel the stars blinking in time with your footsteps. <br><br> 
  You try picking up your pace and slowing down - the stars follow suit.  <br><br> 

  Your eyes follow their trail.   <br><br> 
  The stars dance in time.  <br><br> 
  In reverberation. <br><br> 
  A reverberation in 40 Hz.</p>
  
  The stars continue their 40 Hz twinkle.   <br><br> 
  Theyâ€™re definitely talking behind your back   <br><br>
