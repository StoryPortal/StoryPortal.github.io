  <h1>P2Q1</h1>
  <p>Ok. I think youâ€™re going to have a NICE DAYâ€¦ </p> 

<p>You head out of the house, oblivious to the rest of the world.  As you step out of the door, you see a shooting star! </p>
<p></p>Itâ€™s your l u c k y day.  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  </p>
<p></p>Youâ€™ve never seen a shooting star during the day!  Your brain is OVERLOADED with dopamine.  You search the sky for more day stars :).  </p>
<p>The stars notice you watching them. ðŸ˜¯  </p>

<p>The stars arrive in duos, trios, then a whole ensemble.  As you walk along, you feel the stars blinking in time with your footsteps. </p>
<p>You try picking up your pace and slowing down - the stars follow suit. You feel the stars are winking at you, but maybe youâ€™re just conceited.</p>
<p>Your eyes follow their trail.  The stars dance in time. Their dance is a reverberation.  A reverberation in 40 Hz.</p>

<p>The stars continue their 40 Hz twinkle.  Theyâ€™re definitely talking behind your back  >:> \ </p>
