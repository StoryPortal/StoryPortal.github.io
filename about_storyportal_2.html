  <h1>Story Portal 2 </h1>
  <br>
    <p>This project is part of a larger concept <br> 
    we're developing where users experience the world <br>
    of the story by navigating the characters' desktop <br> 
    computers and physical belongings on their desk. <br><br>
    Here, we've created a desktop portal for our main character, <br>
    inspired by tech bros in Seattle. <br><br>
    Stay tuned for our next installation. <br>
