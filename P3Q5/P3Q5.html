  <h1>P3Q5</h1>
  <p> As the house music plays on, you look out at the window at Elliott Bay and notice the waves becoming more and more regular. <br><br>
    The waves crash with the beat of the music! <br><br>
    The water starts to part and you notice a black hole form.  <br><br>
    You notice a big cloud of colorful butterflies move in a cloud across the water towards the witch’s nest. <br><br>
    The butterflies encircle the nest and one of them says to you,  <br><br>
    “You’ve gotta get out of here!! Some of us will distract her and you can come with us!”
