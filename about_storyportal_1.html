  <h1>About Story Portal 1</h1>
  <p> 
    This is a choose-your-own-adventure style story that takes place in an apocalpytic Seattle. <br> 
    <br><br> 
    We originally showed this project at Art Neureau 2023, <br>
    a neuroscience themed art show hosted by the UW Graduate Program in Neuroscience.<br>
    Inspired by choose-your-own adventure books, online personality tests, and neural circuits,  <br>
    we wanted to create a multimedia project that was greater than the sum of its parts. <br>
    The website is constructed of linked web pages with connected paths informed by neural circuit motifs, <br>
    e.g. recurrence, parallel pathways, feedforward/back. <br><br> <br><br>
