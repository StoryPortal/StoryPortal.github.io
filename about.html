  <h1>About This Project </h1>
  <p> This project is a collaboration between Todd Appleby and Su-Yee Lee, two neuroscientists. <br><br>
    Inspired by choose-your-own adventure books, online personality tests and neural circuits - <br><br>
    we wanted to create a multimedia project that was greater than the sum of its parts. <br><br>
    The website is constructed of linked web pages with connected paths informed by neural circuit motifs, e.g. recurrence, parallel pathways, feedforward/back. <br><br> 
    We hope to make more stories and multimedia content in the future. This is the first. <br><br>
